Running the script on your own machine (in a Python environment with `pandas`
and `nltk` installed) is recommended; however, if you don't have such a Python
environment, using Google Colab is an applicable alternative:

1. Download the files.
2. Open `company_analysis.py` in your favorite text editor; copy and paste its
contents into a Colab notebook.
3. In the "files" tab on the left, upload all files other than `README.md` and
`company_analysis.py`. Then run the code.
